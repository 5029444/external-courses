# Live demo here

As the project involves node.js and MongoBd
I launch a live demo at Heroku.com

https://dry-taiga-37098.herokuapp.com/ 

Take to consideration it may be rather slow sometimes.
Especially at a first call.

Added testing account (e-mail: ttt@ttt.ru pass: ttt ) with some "owned" items
(as the shop cart is not ready yet :-) ) to demonstrate the work of private filters.
